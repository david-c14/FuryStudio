### An application for editing the assets of the game Fury of the Furries

This is a work in progress, and there's very little to see here. What we do have ready, is a small suite of command-line tools that can manipulate some of the Fury of the Furries file formats. More such tools will be added.

Eventually there will be a full Graphical IDE, but that's still quite a way off.
